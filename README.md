# dictionary-bot
Simple discord bot used to get the definitions of words. This project uses [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and a [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/). Unfortunately, due to a lack of maintenance this project no longer works, and I'll have to update it to use [Pycord](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/stable/) instead.
